## Introduction
For this assignment, we're tasked with designing solely for _one_ person. Now, in any other scenario, this would sound like a nightmare - what about accessibility? But there's a catch: the person we design for has some kind of disability, be it that they are blind or have motor problems. We have to design specifically suited to them and their needs. The entire minor is split up into three teams, each team representing one person. Our person is **Nicolette Besemer,** and she's the person for who we have to make, ironically, an _exclusive_ design, as dubbed by teacher Vasilis van Gemert.

### About Nicolette Besemer
Nicolette Besemer is president at Onbeperkt West, among others, and has a passion for geochemistry: this she also graduated from Utrecht University in 1972 where she also taught. She has also taught migrants. She organizes a lot around accessibility for others in her neighborhood. She has also been a geologist by profession and enjoys visiting physical wonders, this comes from a passion for nature.

She has limited use of her limbs and relies on speech software and her drawing tablet to navigate the Web. This means she cannot use shortcuts, making certain actions difficult to perform, including cutting, pasting, selecting and generally navigating. **This is our design challenge for her.**

She has not always been limited, once she became neurologically ill and since then she has been using a wheelchair to get around. She was not always passionate about helping people with disabilities, because she found she had more important things to focus on than simply being disabled; but she describes herself as a people person to the core, so who is she not to help when people are in need? This is how she ended up getting involved in taking the first steps towards accessibility in the city, and she has achieved amazing things since then. If ever anything befell you and you were to end up in a wheelchair, you would surely be thankful to Nicolette; a pioneer in accessibility in Amsterdam, and Amsterdammer of the Year in 2016 as well as Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau, as dubbed by the King of the Netherlands himself!

## Installation
Here are the steps to install my project.

1. Under the `Code` tab at the top.
2. Download this repository as a `.zip` file and unpack it.
3. Locate the folder `HCD-Nicolette`
    - If you have `VS Code`: From here, all you need to do is open the folder in your editor and use the `Live Server` extension to start a local host. This allows you to also view the code and work more hands-on, should you desire.
    - If not, you can find the document on your device, navigate to the `index.html` file (this should be visible just by opening up `HDC-Nicolette`), right-click it and open in a browser of your choosing. I've used Arc and Google Chrome to test this project, so I can recommend these two.
4. Navigate to the iteration of the project you want to view on the home page!

This project is also online: find the link at the top of this repository, under the description on the right! Or, for ease of access, [right here.]()
